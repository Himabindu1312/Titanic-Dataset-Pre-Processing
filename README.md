## Data Preprocessing and Model Training Summary

## Dataset Overview
Dataset: Titanic survival data.
Initial Features: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked.
Target Variable: Survived.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Removed Columns: PassengerId, Cabin, Ticket for simplification.
Extracted Titles: Titles were extracted from the Name column (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss.).
Filled Missing Values:
Age: Filled with the mean age.
Embarked: Filled with the most frequent port.
Label Encoding: Encoded categorical features (Sex, Embarked, New_Name) to numerical values.

## Final Features
Numerical Features: Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare.
Encoded Categorical Features: Sex, Embarked, New_Name.

## Data Split and Scaling
Train-Test Split: 90% training, 10% testing.
Feature Scaling: Standardized the feature values.

## Neural Network Model
Architecture:
Input Layer: 8 features.
Hidden Layers: Two layers with 32 units each, using ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
Output Layer: 1 unit with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Compilation: Optimizer - Adam, Loss function - Binary Crossentropy, Metric - Accuracy.
Training: 100 epochs with a batch size of 64, using 10% of the training data for validation.

## Training Results
Initial Performance: The model started with lower accuracy but improved as epochs progressed.
Validation Accuracy: Steadily improved and plateaued around 80% by the end of training.

## Insights and Next Steps
Model Performance: Achieved reasonable accuracy, indicating the model's ability to generalize well on the training and validation sets.
Feature Importance: Further analysis can be done to determine the importance of each feature and refine the model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different architectures, dropout rates, and other hyperparameters to potentially improve performance.
Further Evaluation: Evaluate on the test set and possibly implement cross-validation for more robust performance metrics.
